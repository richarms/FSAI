## Fundamental Science in the era of AI

In this ICLR workshop, we will explore the intersection of big science and AI and what it means to do good fundamental research in an era when AI is core to the way we as scientists interrogate and understand the physical world. The workshop will also examine how AI can enhance the social good of Big Science, relevant for the African continent given that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will be one of the largest astronomical endeavors ever undertaken, will be majority hosted in Africa. In addition this workshop aims to stimulate discussion across astronomy, cosmology and particle physics. 

Our schedule is built around 4 sessions addressing two cultural & societal topics and two technical topics; namely: 

- Rigorous and interpretable ML for fundamental science - The SKA’s science goals require precise control of systematic errors and yet will deliver exabytes of data that will need machine learning and AI to process.  Fundamental sciences require machine learning models that are interpretable, free from bias and with precise measures of uncertainty. How best can we blend the speed and generality of machine learning with rigorous statistical methodology in a computationally feasible way on exabytes of data? How do we optimally embed known physics, laws and symmetries into deep learning models?

- “Unknown Unknowns” - discovering new classes and new laws - Big science experiments such as SKA, CERN, LIGO, LSST offer incredible opportunities for scientific discovery. However the tsunami of data will require the use of AI to detect anomalies. How do we discover new classes of objects given the No Free Lunch theorems? How can AI best drive new discoveries in fundamental science in exabytes of data? 

- What is good science in the era of AI? Dangers and opportunities -  AI is impacting virtually every aspect of life and the way we do science is no exception. What will the scientific method, and good science in general, look like in 2030?  What are the opportunities and potential dangers of “blackbox” AI science? 

- Social Good through AI for Fundamental Science Research - Most big science experiments are funded at least partly because of their long term contribution to the wellbeing of society. What new opportunities does AI-enhanced science provide for the SKA and other big science experiments to contribute to social good through AI, particularly in Africa? 

Our belief is that this workshop can bring together machine learning experts and astronomers and physicists doing fundamental research at a crucial time for science both worldwide and on the African continent. We aim to stimulate important new collaborations and networks and catalyse radical new ideas on a range of fundamental and important questions.
