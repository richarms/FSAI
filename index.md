# Fundamental Science in the Era of AI

In this ICLR workshop, we will explore the intersection of big science and AI and what it means to do good fundamental research in an era when AI is core to the way we as scientists interrogate and understand the physical world. The workshop will also examine how AI can enhance the social good of Big Science, relevant for the African continent given that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will be one of the largest astronomical endeavors ever undertaken, will be majority hosted in Africa. In addition this workshop aims to stimulate discussion across astronomy, cosmology and particle physics. 

Our schedule is built around 4 sessions addressing two cultural & societal topics and two technical topics; namely: 

- Rigorous and interpretable ML for fundamental science - The SKA’s science goals require precise control of systematic errors and yet will deliver exabytes of data that will need machine learning and AI to process.  Fundamental sciences require machine learning models that are interpretable, free from bias and with precise measures of uncertainty. How best can we blend the speed and generality of machine learning with rigorous statistical methodology in a computationally feasible way on exabytes of data? How do we optimally embed known physics, laws and symmetries into deep learning models?

- “Unknown Unknowns” - discovering new classes and new laws - Big science experiments such as SKA, CERN, LIGO, LSST offer incredible opportunities for scientific discovery. However the tsunami of data will require the use of AI to detect anomalies. How do we discover new classes of objects given the No Free Lunch theorems? How can AI best drive new discoveries in fundamental science in exabytes of data? 

- What is good science in the era of AI? Dangers and opportunities -  AI is impacting virtually every aspect of life and the way we do science is no exception. What will the scientific method, and good science in general, look like in 2030?  What are the opportunities and potential dangers of “blackbox” AI science? 

- Social Good through AI for Fundamental Science Research - Most big science experiments are funded at least partly because of their long term contribution to the wellbeing of society. What new opportunities does AI-enhanced science provide for the SKA and other big science experiments to contribute to social good through AI, particularly in Africa? 

Our belief is that this workshop can bring together machine learning experts and astronomers and physicists doing fundamental research at a crucial time for science both worldwide and on the African continent. We aim to stimulate important new collaborations and networks and catalyse radical new ideas on a range of fundamental and important questions. 

### Submissions

Papers should be in anonymous ICLR style and up to 5 pages, with an unlimited number of pages for references and appendix. Accepted papers will be presented during our poster session and made available on the workshop website. Selected authors will be offered a 10 min talk at the workshop. This does not constitute an archival publication and no formal workshop proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish their work at journals or conferences.

### Diversity Statement 

As an already diverse team who run most of our workshops in Africa, we are committed to nurturing talent and diversity in developing communities. We are experienced in accommodating diverse backgrounds to create an inclusive environment for all. Participants will be asked to sign a code of conduct agreeing to respect for all participants.  

In addition we will select speakers for our workshop in a way that balances scientific excellence and diversity across gender, geography etc… with a focus on choosing people with an interest in forming diverse collaborations that include the developing world.  

### Biographies of Organisers
- Prof Bruce Bassett - Head of Data Science at the South African Radio Astronomical Observatory & Head of Cosmology at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cape Town, South Africa. Member of the Advisory Council of the International Astroinformatics Association and former Vice-President of the International Astrostatistics Association.  

- Dr Michelle Lochner - A young South African researcher with a joint position between the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the South African Radio Astronomical Observatory responsible for SKA in Africa. She is the founding director of the Supernova Foundation, https://supernovafoundation.org/, that provides mentorship for young women from the developing world in science. https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?hl=en&user=9AnikoEAAAAJ  

- Dr. Nadeem Oozeer -  originally from Mauritius, Nadeem is a Senior Data Scientist at the South African Radio Astronomical Observatory working on the SKA in Africa and has organised more than 15 graduate workshops across Africa. His publications are available at:  https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?hl=en&user=2Rgt91gAAAAJ 

- Dr Richard Armstrong - is a senior data scientist at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.

The team of Nadeem, Richard and Michelle played a leading role in the scientific organisation of  the recent Big Data Africa School. 

### Funding 
Seed funding for the workshop will be available through the South African Radio Astronomical Observatory and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences which will cover the travel and accommodation expenses for the organisers and one invited speaker.  Additional funding will be sought. 

We expect we will need funding to support at least one additional speaker. Extra funds will be used to support geographic diversity and those coming from poorer nations.
